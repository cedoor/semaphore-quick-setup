# Basic Sample Semaphore Project (Hardhat)

This project demonstrates a basic Semaphore use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract and a sample task that deploys that contract.

This repository contains the code used in the Semaphore [quick-setup](https://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/docs/quick-setup) section.
